*   **Customizable Alerts:** Set up alerts for negative reviews or specific keywords to proactively address concerns.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Laravel (PHP Framework)
*   **Frontend:** React
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **PHP:** Version 8.1 or higher
*   **Composer:** Dependency manager for PHP
*   **Node.js:** Version 16 or higher
*   **npm:** Node Package Manager (usually included with Node.js)
*   **MySQL:** Or another compatible database system
*   **Redis:** For caching and queue management

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd review-sentry
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Configure the environment:**

    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

    *   Edit the `.env` file and configure your database connection, Redis connection, and other environment variables (API keys, etc.).  Ensure the following are properly configured: `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`.

4.  **Generate application key:**

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations:**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

6.  **Seed the database (optional, for development):**

    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

7.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

## Development Setup

1.  **Start the Laravel development server:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    php artisan serve
    ```

    (The default address is `http://127.0.0.1:8000`)

2.  **Start the React development server:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

    (The default address is `http://localhost:3000`)

    Ensure that the frontend is configured to communicate with the Laravel backend (typically through API calls to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).  Update the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in your frontend's `.env` or configuration file accordingly.

## Usage Examples

1.  **Adding a Review Source:** Use the platform's interface (or API) to connect to a review platform (e.g., Google My Business). You will need to provide the necessary API keys and authentication credentials.
2.  **Viewing Aggregated Reviews:**  Navigate to the "Reviews" dashboard to see all reviews from connected sources, categorized by sentiment.
3.  **Responding to a Review:**  Select a review and click "Generate Response" to get an AI-suggested reply.  Edit the suggestion to match your brand voice and then post the response directly from the platform.
4.  **Monitoring Reputation Trends:**  View charts and graphs on the "Reputation" dashboard to track sentiment trends and identify areas where your business can improve.

## API Documentation Structure

The API follows RESTful principles.  Base URL will be defined in your `.env` file (VITE_API_BASE_URL). All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api`. Authentication is typically done through API keys.

**Example Endpoints:**

*   `GET /api/reviews`: Returns a list of all reviews (paginated).
    *   Query parameters: `page`, `sentiment` (positive, negative, neutral), `source` (google, yelp, etc.)
*   `GET /api/reviews/{id}`: Returns a specific review by ID.
*   `POST /api/reviews/{id}/response`:  Posts a response to a review.
    *   Request body: `content` (the response text)
*   `GET /api/sources`: Returns a list of connected review sources.
*   `POST /api/sources`:  Adds a new review source.
    *   Request body:  Source specific configuration (API keys, etc.)
*   `GET /api/sentiment`: Returns overall sentiment analysis data.

**Response Format:**

All API responses are in JSON format. Success responses typically include a `data` field containing the requested information and a `status` code of 200.  Error responses include a `message` field and an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 400 for bad request, 401 for unauthorized, 500 for server error).

A full, auto-generated API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI) is planned for future versions.
